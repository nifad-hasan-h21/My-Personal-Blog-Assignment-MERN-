        <h2>Welcome to my personal blog</h2>
        <p>This is my personal space where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences on a wide range of topics that inspire me. Whether it’s something I have recently learned, a moment that made me reflect, or simply an idea I want to explore, this blog is a place for me to express and connect. My goal is not just to document my journey but also to create content that resonates with others, sparks curiosity, and encourages meaningful conversations.</p>

            <h3>Embedded Video</h3>
            <p>Alongside my written posts, I also want to bring a more engaging experience to this blog through videos. A video will be featured here soon, offering a closer look into my journey, projects, and creative process. Sometimes, words alone are not enough to capture the full essence of a moment, and I believe video is a powerful way to share emotions and experiences more vividly. Keep an eye on this space for upcoming visual content that adds another dimension to the stories I share.</p>
